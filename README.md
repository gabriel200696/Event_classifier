#Binary Event Classifier for Power System Data

This repository contains the implementation of a binary classification model developed to detect power system events using real synchrophasor (PMU) measurements from the Brazilian Interconnected Power System (BIPS).

The model leverages neural network techniques and customized evaluation metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis to accurately distinguish between true and false events, addressing the challenges present in low-voltage PMU data.
